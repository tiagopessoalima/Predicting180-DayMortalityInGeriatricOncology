ALPHA = 0.05 # is a constant that is commonly used in statistical hypothesis testing to determine the significance level of a test. The value of ALPHA is typically set to 0.05 (or 5%), which means there is a 5% chance that the test results will be considered significant by chance. The value of ALPHA is used in conjunction with the p-value calculated from the data to determine whether the null hypothesis should be rejected or not.

DAYS = 180 # represents the specified duration, in days, for categorizing deaths that occur in the period following a cancer diagnosis.

RANDOM_STATE = 42 # is a constant that is typically used to initialize the random number generator in a library or algorithm that uses randomness in some aspect of its operation. This means that when the RANDOM_STATE is fixed to a certain value, the algorithm will generate the same random results every time it is run, which can be useful for reproducing results and ensuring result consistency.
